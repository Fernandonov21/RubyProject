# Ruby Hello World Project

## Project Description

This is a simple "Hello World" Ruby application to demonstrate the basics of Ruby programming and containerization using Docker. The project aims to show how Ruby can be executed in a containerized environment, making it easy to run and share across different systems.

In this project, we used Ruby to print "Hello World" to the console. We also created a Dockerfile to containerize the application, ensuring that it runs smoothly in different environments without any additional setup.

### Technologies Used
- Ruby (Programming language)
- Docker (Containerization)
